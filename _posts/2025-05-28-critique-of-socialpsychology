"As long as humans are regarded primarily in terms of 'sex', the concept of 'family' includes not only married couples but also 'sexual' relationships—even between parents and children or siblings.
In this sense, the Freudian thesis was not wrong. 
However, he failed to recognize that this kind of relationship can exist only in the realm of 'sexual' fantasy, and extend into nether social collectiveness nor personal imagination."
（人間を〈性〉としてみるかぎり〈家族〉は夫婦ばかりでなく、親子や兄弟や姉妹の関係でも大なり小なり〈性〉的である。この意味でおそらくフロイトの学説には錯誤はなかった。ただかれはこういう関係が〈対〉幻想の領域でだけ成り立つもので、けっしてそのまま社会の共同性や個人のもつ幻想性には拡張できないことをその考察から除いてしまったのである。）
(Takaaki Yoshimoto. (1982). _Theoly of Collected Fantasy_. Kadokawa.)

Freud's failure lies in his inability to distinguish between the realms of 'sexual' fantasy, collective imagination, and personal fantasy.  
Spinoza made a similar point: according to him, we must distinguish between the subjectivity of the state and that of the individual.
When we read Hegel's social philosophy, we must pay attention to whether we can avoid these criticisms or not.
