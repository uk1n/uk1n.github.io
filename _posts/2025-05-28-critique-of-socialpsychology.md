"As long as humans are regarded primarily in terms of 'sex', the concept of 'family' includes not only married couples but also 'sexual' relationshipsâ€”even between parents and children or siblings.
In this sense, the Freudian thesis was not wrong. 
However, he failed to recognize that this kind of relationship can exist only in the realm of 'sexual' fantasy, and extend into nether social collectiveness nor personal imagination."
(Takaaki Yoshimoto. (1982). _Theoly of Collected Fantasy_. Kadokawa.)

A Freud's failure occures because he did not distinguish the realm of 'sexual' fantasy, collectiveness, and personal fantasy.
