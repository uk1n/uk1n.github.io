1. Recognition as a source of objectivity

"our certainty that what we perceive has an existence independent of the act of perceiving depends entirely on the object's also appearing as such to others and being acknowledged by them. 
Without this tacit acknowledgment by others, we would not even be able to put faith in the way we appear to ourselves 
(Arendt, H. (1977–1978). The Life of the Mind. San Diego: Harcourt, Inc. Vol. 1. p. 46)."

2. Recognition as a source of humanity

"It is the inter-subjectivity of the world, rather than similarity of physical appearance, that convinces men that they belong to the same species 
(Arendt, H. (1977–1978). The Life of the Mind. San Diego: Harcourt, Inc. Vol. 1. p. 50). " 
This profound insight reveals not only why one regards another as a member of the same species, but also why one can so easily dismiss the other's individuality and commit acts of mass violence. 
"Some lives are grievable, and others are not" 
(Butler, J. (2004). Precarious life: the powers of mourning and violence. London: Verso, p. xiv.). 
"both our political and ethical responsibilities are rooted in the recognition" (p. xiii). 
The concept of human rights is inherently fragile, as it inevitably depends on mutual recognition.
