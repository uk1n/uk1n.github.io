"It is fair to say that the fundamental ambition of German Idealism (including Kant) is an overall theory of human rationality and its place in nature.
How is it possible to make sense of our first-person, engaged point of view in light of the anonymizing pressure modern philosophy ascribes to the ever-increasing influence of natural-scientific discoveries on our self-image as animalia rationalia?
German Idealism is a response to the naturalistic challenge that takes naturalism very seriously."
(Gabriel, M. and Rasmussen, A. M. (Eds.). (2017). German Idealism Today. Berlin: De Gruyter, p.vii)

This summary is correct. 
One of the biggest issues in Hegelian philosophy is discerning the element of the so-called "spirit" within or without the all-encompassing nature that modern scientists consciously or unconsciously presuppose.
